Cell culture and treatments
The oral squamous carcinoma cell line OSCC-3 was kindly pro-
vided by Dr. Márcio Fonseca, University of Brasília, who originally
acquired it from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). Cells
were maintained at 37

 in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Ea-
gle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. All cell culture reagents were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, USA).
For the experiments, cells were seeded at the densities of 

cells/well in 6-well plates for cell viability; 1.5

cells/well in 24-well plates for cell toxicity assay and 1.2

cells/10 cm (diameter) round plates for DNA fragmentation and
immunoblot assays. Cells were treated with 500
l
g/mL of each
fraction or TCE for 24 and 48 h. For determining the dose–response
curve, decreasing concentrations were used, as indicated. Every
experiment was performed at least three independent times.
Extract puriﬁcation and fractionation
Plant material
Leaves of 
 Nicotiana tabacum
 L. (Burley type) were harvested
from the Botanical Garden of the Facultad de Ciencias Químicas
(FCQ), located in the Campus of the Universidad Nacional de Asun-
ción in San Lorenzo, Paraguay, on September 2004. A voucher spec-
imen, identiﬁed by Germán González Salema, is deposited at the
Herbarium FCQ (G Delmás 210).
Extract 
Dried plantmaterialwas ground toa coarsepowder usinga kni-
ves mill.The powderwassubmittedtoextractionwithmethanolat
room temperature, with occasional stirring. The extracts were ﬁl-
tered and pooled prior to be concentrated by a rotary vacuum
evaporation below 40
 
C, generating the tobacco crude extract
(TCE).
Fractionation
TCE was fractionated as previously described
13
with modiﬁca-
tions. TCE was dissolved in ethyl acetate (Fraction A), with 38.4%
of the initial material remaining as insoluble fraction (Fraction
B). The obtained soluble portion (A) was submitted to liquid–liquid
partition, originating the following fractions: fraction A1 (sodium
bicarbonate saturated solution); fraction A2 (sodium hydroxide
1 M); fraction A3 (hydrochloric acid 20%). Finally, the remainder
organic fraction was also washed with sodium bicarbonate satu-
rated solution and the solvent evaporated, generating fraction A4.
To obtain stock solutions for testing, TCE and its fractions were di-
luted as follows: TCE in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO):ethanol (2:3),
A1 in PBS, and A4 in ethanol. After dilution, the solutions were
cleared by centrifugation and the pellet weight subtracted from
the initial weight to calculate the actual concentration, which var-
ied from 30 to 150 mg/mL. Stock solutions were kept at
 
20
 
C in
the dark until use.
Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
The samples were submitted to TLC in silica gel (silicagel/TLC
cards, Fluka) in comparison with nicotine (Sigma), using the mix-
ture hexane:ethyl acetate (6:4) as eluent. The obtained chromato-
gram was revealed with modiﬁed Dragendorff reagent.

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and treated with TCE or its
fractions at 500
l
g/mL for 24 or 48 h; or with equal volume of 
vehicles. After treatment, cells were collected by trypsinization
and centrifugation, washed once with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS), stained with trypan blue solution (0.2% in PBS) for 5 min
at room temperature and immediately inspected in a hemocytom-
eter. The percentage of viable cells upon each treatment was ob-
tained by counting blue and total cells.
Cell cytotoxic assay and dose–response curve
Cell seeding and treatment were done as described above. After
treatment, dead (ﬂoating) cells were washed out with PBS.
Remaining adherent live cells were ﬁxed with methanol 100% for
20 min and stained with crystal violet solution (0.2% in methanol)
for 5 min at room temperature. After extensive washing, dye-up-
take by cells was assessed by recovery with citrate-based alcoholic
solution (sodium citrate 0.1 M and ethanol 50%) and absorbance at
570 nm was measured at a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
DNA fragmentation assay
Cells were treated with TCE and fractions A1 and A4 at 500
l
g/
mL for the indicated periods of time. Positive (staurosporine
200 nM, and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5FU) 1 mg/mL) and negative (vehicles)
controls were included in the experimental conditions. After 48 h
of treatment, ﬂoating and adherent cells were collected, lyzed in
SDS buffer solution (0.2 M EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5% w/v Triton
X-100, 2% w/v SDS) and total DNA was puriﬁed using the phenol/
chloroform method, followed by alcoholic precipitation. Two
micrograms of the obtainedmaterialwere subjected to electropho-
resis on a 1.5% agarose gel, containing ethidium bromide (1 ng/
mL). Bands were visualized under UV light and images were ac-
quired on an Eagle eye Acquisition System.
Immuno-blotting 
Total proteins were extracted with NP40-buffer (50 mM
Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
PMSF, 1% w/v NP-40), snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen
until use. Quantiﬁcation was performed using the Bio-Rad
Protein Assay. Twenty-ﬁve micrograms of total proteins were
subjected to SDS–PAGE on a 12.5% acrylamide gel, transferred
to nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer system
and methanol/glycine-based buffer. The membrane was blocked
with 5% non-fat milk in TTBS, prior to incubation with speciﬁc
antibodies. Antibodies for caspase-3 and tubulin were 9662
(Cell Signaling), and E1707 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA),
respectively. Secondary anti-goat and anti-rabbit antibodies,
conjugated with HRP, were purchased from Santa-Cruz Biotech-
nology, USA. Decorated proteins were visualized with chemolu-
minescent ECL-plus (Amersham, USA) on radiographic ﬁlms
(Kodak, USA). Each experiment was done at least three indepen-
dent times.
Statistical analysis of data
All data were analyzed using the PRISM 3.0 GraphPad software,
according to statistical parameters described in the ﬁgure legends.

Results
Tobacco crude extract (TCE) reduces cell viability and induces cell
death in a dose-dependent manner 
To evaluate the effects of tobacco crude extract (TCE) on cell
viability, cells were treated with either TCE (500
l
g/mL) or vehicle
alone for 24 and 48 h, and viability was assessed by trypan blue
exclusion. TCE treatment reduced cell viability to 78.0% and 5.0%
at 24 h and 48 h, respectively (
Fig. 1
A). TCE cytotoxicity was as-
sessed by crystal violet staining of remaining (alive) cells
(
Fig. 1
B). TCE treatment for 24 and 48 h caused 68.0% and 85.0%
of cell death respectively, when compared to the vehicle alone.
To test whether TCE-mediated cytotoxicity was dose-depen-
dent, cells were treated with decreasing concentrations (500,
250, 100, 50, 10 and 0
l
g/mL) of TCE for 24 h and cell survival
was measured by spectrophotometry(
Fig.2
). At concentrations be-
low 100
l
g/mL, TCE did not induce cytotoxicity, but treatment
with higher concentrations resulted in decreased cell survival
(88.4%, 53.0% and 31.1% upon treatment with 100
l
g/mL, 250
l
g/
mL and 500
l
g/mL TCE, respectively). The calculated EC50 for
TCE was 344.35
l
g/mL. Collectively, these results indicate that to-
bacco crude extract is cytotoxic to oral cancer cells, and exerts its
effects in a dose-dependent manner.
Cytotoxicity induced by tobacco extract fractions
Because TCE comprises many different chemical compounds,
we investigated whether fractions of TCE with distinct solubility
properties (fractions A1 and A4) could likewise induce cell death
(
Fig. 3
). After 24 h treatment, TCE and fraction A4 were able to sig-
niﬁcantly reduce cell survival, whereas fraction A1 was innocuous
(
Fig. 3
). After 48 h, a marked cytotoxic effect could be seen upon
treatmentwithTCE (15.1% survival) andwithfraction A4(6.2% sur-
vival). Overall, these results indicate the presence of chemical com-
pounds in TCE and fraction A4 capable of inducing cell death.
To verify the absence of nicotine in fraction A4, a thin layer
chromatography (TLC) was performed. Upon development with
the Dragendoff reagent, the nicotine region in the TLC plate
showed the expected orange color, characteristic of alkaloids,
whereas fraction A4 did not develop any color. These results indi-
cate that neither nicotine nor other alkaloids are present in fraction
A4.

DNA fragmentation assay
Cell death can take place via necrosis, with cytoplasm extrusion,
or via apoptosis, the programmed pathway of cell elimination, de-
void of intracellular content shedding. During the later, DNA is
methodically digested between the nucleosomes, generating frag-
ments of deﬁned size. In addition, apoptotic events are mediated
through a cascade of zymogens termed caspases. To test whether
tobacco-mediated cell death was necrotic or apoptotic, DNA frag-
mentation assays and immunoblotting for cleaved caspase-3 were
performed, using 5-ﬂuorouracil (1 mg/mL), a chemotherapic agent
and staurosporine (200 nM), a known apoptotic-inducer, as posi-
tive controls.
 Fig. 4
 shows DNA fragmentation (‘‘laddering”) caused
by treatment with staurosporine, TCE and fraction A4. Treatment
with vehicle or medium alone resulted in a single DNA band, indi-
cating the absence of DNA cleavage. Additionally, fraction A1 was
not able to induce DNA fragmentation. These results indicate that
the cytotoxicity observed upon treatment with TCE and fraction
A4 was apoptotic.
Caspase-3 mediates the cell death induced by TCE and neutral fraction
To conﬁrm that both TCE and fraction A4 induced cell death via
apoptosis, an immunoblot using an antibody that recognizes both
cleaved and intact forms of caspase-3 was done (
Fig. 5
). Treatment
with staurosporine and 5FU was included as above.
The intact form of caspase was visible in all samples. Treatment
with TCE and fraction A4 resulted in caspase-3 activation, as noted
by a 17 kDa band, corresponding to its cleaved form. This band was
absent from samples treated with fraction A1 as well as in the neg-
ative controls. These results allowed us to conclude that both TCE
and its A4 fraction induced caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.
Discussion
Our study aimed at investigating the cytotoxic activity of TCE
and two of its fractions on human oral squamous cell carcinoma.
Our data showed that TCE was able to induce cell death in the
OSCC-3 cell line via apoptosis. This is in agreement with previous
work,
9
which showed that tobacco extract could also induce apop-
tosis in HCPC-1 cells, a cell lineage of Syrian hamster oral epider-
moid cell carcinoma. In addition, the ability of TCE to induce cell
death was dose-dependent, and occurred via caspase-activation,
accompanied by extensive DNA fragmentation. These results, how-
ever, do not rule out the possibility that TCE-induced cell death
could occur via alternative mechanisms. For example, it has been
reported that tobacco
9
induces cell death via nitric oxide and
through the formation of reactive oxygen species. Other studies
have additionally proposed that the lignins found in several plant
extracts could trigger apoptosis by inducing DNA damage.
15
To
determine the amount of lignin present in TCE and fractions was
out of the scope of the present work.
We have extended the analyses of TCE-induced cell death by
using two (A1 and A4) fractions thereof. From these, only fraction
A4 showed signiﬁcant cytotoxicity and apoptosis, which suggest
the presence of chemical components capable of inducing cell
death. However, at this point it is impossible to determine whether
the observed cytotoxicity was caused by only one component or
was resultant from synergic effects of several compounds. The
identiﬁcation of such compound(s) could result in the develop-
ment of a new therapeutic to manage oral cancer.
Plant derived therapeutics to treat cancer have long been em-
ployed. For instance taxol, vincristine and vinblastine were origi-
nally derived from the genders
 Taxus brevifolia
 and
 Catharanthus
roseus.
 Other alternative extracts were also effective in oral cancer
cell lines, such as the one from
 Ginkgo biloba
, which induced cas-
pase-3-mediated apoptosis in human cancer cells.
16
However, because tobacco smoke is the leading cause of cancer
development in the oral cavity, its usage as cytotoxic (anti-cancer)
agent is at best controversial. Tobacco is a complex mixture of 
many different chemicals, which can both induce and inhibit apop-
tosis.
17
In this sense, it is possible that tobacco-induced tumorigen-
esis results from the synergism of compounds which would
normally lead to opposing effects. For instance, DNA damaging
agents would cause cell death in normal cells; a property shared
with many chemotherapeutics. However, because compounds
which are anti-apoptotic are also present, cells fail to die, and
hence accumulate mutations that ultimately lead to cancer forma-
tion.
6
This mechanism for tumorigenesis seems to hold true in the
view that nicotine, for instance, has been reported to both potenti-
ate the mutagenic effect of nitrosamines
8
and to reduce the cyto-
toxicity of cisplatin in human oral cancer cells,
10
and of 
doxorubicin in KB-3-1cervicalcarcinomaandMCF-7humanbreast
cancer cells.
11
Several pathways seem to be involved in the ob-
served interference such as AKT, Erk1/2, NF-
j
B, and Bax.
10,18–20
Curiously, nicotine has also been shown to have an anti-prolif-
erative effect on human keratinocytes and to interfere with their
cell cycle and differentiation.
12
In our experiments, nicotine alone
had no effect on OSCC-3 proliferation (data not shown), in accor-
dance to what others have reported.

despite its wide range, it still remains one of theleast studied Neotropical cats (Silveira 1995,Nowell & Jackson 1996). Pampas catseems to berare in Brazil, where it is considered threatened(Bernardes
et al 
. 1990), but tends to be morecommon in the temperate parts of its range(Oliveira 1994).Herein we present new records on the geographicdistribution, habitat utilization, diet, and externalmeasurements of 
O. colocolo
in the Cerrado of Central Brazil (Fig. 1). Data were obtained fromtwenty-eight records [nine road killed indivi-duals, seven sightings, two captures (TadeuOliveira, pers. comm.), nine tracks and one skinacquired from hunters – Table 1]. Although thepampas cat shares its habitat with sympatric smallwild felids, there are significant differences intheir prints, reflected from morphological andbiometric differences (Rogerio de Paula, unpub-lished data). Four road killed specimens weredeposited in scientific collections: UNB 1741and UNB 1742, from Palmas, Tocantins State(deposited in mammal collection of Universidadede Brasília, Distrito Federal); JD346, fromChapada dos Guimarães, Mato Grosso State (inmammal collection reference of Institute of Bionciences of Universidade do Mato Grosso);and MN 63629, from Emas National Park,Goiás State (in Museu Nacional – UniversidadeFederal do Rio de Janeiro).The Cerrado biome occupies an area of 2,000,000 km

We recorded the Pampas Cat only in open areas(Table 1), as already cited by Silveira (1995), butit could be found both in natural areas, like opengrasslands (17.9%) and savanna (cerrado
sensustricto
– 57.1%) and in disturbed areas, such aspastures (3.6%) and agricultural fields (3.6%), orin edges of grasslands and agricultural fields(3.6%) and savanna and pastures (14.3%),demonstrating that this species is able to usehuman altered habitats. In Brazil, the PampasCat inhabits open areas, like the grasslands of thePampas, the marshy Pantanal, and specially thesavannas of the Cerrado biome (this study,Silveira 1995). However, in other range countrieswithin its distribution range it is found in a broader variety of habitats, from humid forests tohigh altitude semiarid scrub (Oliveira 1994).The diet is said to include primarily small rodentsand ground birds (Ihering 1892, Cabrera & Yepes 1960, Silva 1994, Romo 1995). Weobtained stomachs contents data from four roadkilled individuals. The first ingested two lizards, a Teiidae (fragments of 
 Ameiva 
sp. or
Cnemi-dophorus 
sp.) and a Tropiduridae (
Tropidurus 
sp.). The second stomach contained a tegu lizard(
Tupinambis 
sp.), a colubrid snake (unidenti-fied), and plant material (unidentified grass). Thethird contained a diurnal and crepuscular rodent(
Cavia 
sp.). The fourth contained a tinamous(
Nothura 
sp.) and fragments of an unidentifiedrodent and of beetles. Although predation onsmall caviomorph rodents (
Cavia 
genus) hadbeen previously recorded in anecdotal studies(Ihering 1892, Cabrera & Yepes 1960), as well asground dwelling birds, such as tinamous(Cabrera & Yepes 1960), consumption of reptilesis reported for the first time. All the preys record-ed in pampas cat stomachs in these study can beassociated to natural and human transformedhabitats.In relation to the activity time, three sightingswere at night (19:00, 20:00 and 22:00h), where-as four were in daytime (07:45, 08:00, 16:00and 18:00h), in agreement with the literature(Silveira 1995). Additionally, prey taken alsosuggests both nocturnal and diurnal activity pattern.Road kills represents a source of mortality formammals, especially carnivores (Vieira 1996,Rodrigues
et al 
. 2002), and seems to be animportant threat for pampas cat conservation. We recorded seven specimens of 
O. colocolo
killedin roads and other studies also recorded PampasCats road killed (Fischer 1997). Considering thatPampas Cat is a rare species in Brazil, road mor-tality may represent a strong impact for somepopulations. However, the primary threat toPampas Cat conservation should still be habitatdestruction. The species in Brazil is frequently associated to open habitats. The Emas NationalPark, where this species is commonly observed,the Grande Sertão Veredas National Park and theSerra da Canastra National Park are covered by large extensions of open grasslands and savanna habitats, representing though important areas forits conservation in Brazil. These open vegetationformations are becoming very scarce due tomachinery because agricultural expansion. Myers
et al 
. (2000) estimates that about 80% of theCerrado biome is already altered by human activ-ities. Although this species can cross human dis-turbed areas between natural fragments, probably it does not survive in landscapes dominated total-ly by pastures or agriculture fields. The conserva-tion of the pampas cat in Brazil depends on thepreservation and maintenance of natural grass-lands and other habitats that still exist in theCerrado biome.
